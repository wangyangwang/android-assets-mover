# android-assets-mover

this is a tool i wrote for preparing mobile design assets ( android platform )
in android development, we usually have assets folders like 

  - drawable-xhdpi
  - drawable-xxhdpi
  - drawable-xxxhdpi
  - drawable-mdpi
  - drawable-hdpi
  
  ...
  
  when we export assets from Sketch, we usually have all of the images with different resolutions in one place. If we do it manually, we need to change the names of the files one by one and put them into the right folder.
  which is really time consuming. so I wrote this tool to help identity, rename and move files to the right place.
  
  v1:
  all variables are hard coded. 
  
  coming:
  v2: 
  added interface for changing variables ( path and name of files.. )
